# Abstract
One of the most significant difficulties that higher education institutions encounter today is improving student placement performance. Placements are the essential factor in determining admission and a school's reputation. As a result, every university strives to improve its placement rate for every department. Every student desires to have a job offer before graduating from college. Educational institutions seek more efficient technology to aid in improved administration and decision-making procedures and help them develop new strategies. A placement prediction system can forecast which type of student can be placed. It allows students to see where they stand and what they need to do to get a good placement.
This project proposes a student placement prediction model that uses the Naive Bayes method to determine the likelihood of students being placed. This methodology aids an organizationâ€™s placement cell in identifying prospective students and paying attention to and improves their technical and interpersonal abilities. Students can put more effort into this approach to be placed in organizations with more significant hierarchies.
